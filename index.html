        <p>Nearly all commercial and residential consumers are concerned about modern cybersecurity practices. Something as simple as <strong>NOT</strong> reusing passwords can add a tremendous layer of protection for most users. Many anti-virus software
            companies include a password creater; Norton 360 for example. Google Chrome also includes this feature. Users have the ability to save login and password information. </p>
        <p>Another option is to use or write your own password creator. In this method, once the password is set, copy the password to a document along with the details of the site or software. </p>
        <p>As an additional layer of protection, add 2-step verification. Google offers this service for account holders for free. Even if your email account has been "hacked ", the intruder would also have to "hack " your 2-step verification source; which
            could be your phone or a token. In most cases, that is just too much work for the average hacker. They would prefer to go after softer targets.
